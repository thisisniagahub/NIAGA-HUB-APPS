Navigate your computer using natural hand-drawn sketches.

GLOBAL / DESKTOP
----------------
1. Delete Item: 
   Draw an "X" or a cross over any app icon or folder to delete it.

2. Explode Folder: 
   Draw outward pointing arrows coming out of a folder to "explode" it and reveal its contents on the desktop.

3. Get Info / Summarize: 
   Draw a question mark "?" over an item.
   - If it's a folder, it lists contents.
   - If it's a text file, it reads and summarizes the text.

4. Generate Wallpaper: 
   Draw a sketch on the empty background (mountains, flowers, abstract shapes) to generate a new AI wallpaper based on your drawing.

MAIL APP
--------
1. Delete Email: 
   Draw a horizontal line (strike-through) or an "X" over an email row.

2. Summarize Email: 
   Draw a question mark "?" over an email row or highlight it to get a one-sentence summary of the email body.

TIPS
----
- Ensure your ink contrasts with the background.
- Distinct shapes work best.`

Elara lived in a small cottage at the edge of the Whispering Woods, a place where the trees murmured secrets to those willing to listen. Her only companion was Barnaby, a scruffy terrier mix with one ear that stood at attention and another that flopped lazily over his brow. 

They were a pair, Elara and Barnaby. Where she went, he trotted behind, his nails clicking a familiar rhythm on the cobblestones of the village or sinking silently into the moss of the forest floor. He was her shadow, her confidant, and her anchor in a world that often felt too large and too loud.

One bitter winter evening, a storm rolled in, fierce and howling. The wind rattled the windowpanes like an angry spirit demanding entry. Elara sat by the hearth, knitting a scarf, while Barnaby dozed at her feet, chasing dream-rabbits with twitching paws. Suddenly, the power cut, plunging the cottage into darkness.

Barnaby was up in an instant. He didn't whine. He simply pressed his warm flank against Elara's leg, a sturdy, living presence in the void. He guided her, step by step, to the kitchen where the candles were kept, his low woof signaling obstacles she couldn't see. 

As they sat together by candlelight, the storm raging outside, Elara buried her face in his fur. He smelled of pine needles and rain. "You're a good boy, Barnaby," she whispered. He licked her hand, a rough, wet sandpaper kiss that said, clearer than any words, "I am here. We are safe."

Years passed, and Barnaby's muzzle turned gray. His walks became slower, his naps longer. But the look in his eyes—that adoration, that absolute, unwavering trust—never dimmed. And when the day came that he could no longer stand, Elara sat with him on the floor, holding his paw as he drifted away. 

The cottage felt empty afterwards, the silence deafening. But sometimes, when the wind blew through the Whispering Woods, Elara could swear she heard the click-click-click of nails on the floorboards, and felt a phantom warmth against her leg, reminding her that love, once given, never truly leaves.`
